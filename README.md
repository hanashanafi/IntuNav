# IntuNav
IntuNav is an intuitive first-person navigation algorithm designed for desktop-based virtual environments (VE). This system was developed using Unity 2022.3.10f1
The algorithm offers a natural and efficient method for controlling movement and orientation using a standard computer mouse, allowing for first-person shooter (FPS)-style navigation without the need for VR headsets or complex input devices.

**The system supports:**
Intuitive rotation and movement control (single-device operation)
Adaptive cursor zone logic for navigation prediction
Lightweight algorithm for desktop VR integration

**How to Use**
To use this algorithm, you need to download the Multi-Browser VE from this link https://github.com/hanashanafi/Multi-Browser-dekstopVR-1
Then Integration (Unity):
Add the CamComplex.cs script to your Main Camera object.
Press Play or Build and Run, and navigate using only the mouse.
