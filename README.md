# IntuNav
IntuNav is a desktop-based Virtual Reality (VR) navigation system designed for intuitive interaction using a standard computer mouse. It was developed as part of a PhD research project at the University of Pannonia to explore usability, cognitive load, and user experience in virtual environments without the need for VR headsets.
